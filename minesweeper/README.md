# Faisal's Minesweeper
A simple Minesweeper game for web built using JS, HTML and CSS.

Only vanilla JavaScript has been used to build this game. Just run the index.html file to play.

You will be prompted to enter difficulty when you begin:
Enter 1 for easy and 2 for hard.

The rules are same as any traditional Minesweeper game.

Enjoy!!!
